Feature: Manage Providers via API
  As a client of conductor,
  In order to manage the full life cycle of providers in the system
  I want to be able to Create, Update and Delete providers via a RESTful API

  Background:
    Given I am an authorised user
    And I use my authentication credentials in each request

  Scenario: Get list of providers as XML
    Given there are some providers
    When I request a list of providers returned as XML
    Then I should receive list of providers as XML

  Scenario: Get details for provider as XML
    Given there is a provider
    When I ask for details of that provider as XML
    Then I should receive details of that provider as XML

  Scenario: Get details for non existing provider
    When I ask for details of non existing provider as XML
    Then I should receive Not Found error

  Scenario: Create a new provider
    When I create provider with correct data via XML
    Then I should receive OK message
    And the provider should be created

  Scenario: Create a new provider with bad request
    When I create provider with incorrect data via XML
    Then I should receive Bad Request error
    And the provider should not be created

  Scenario: Update a provider
    Given there is a provider
    When I update that provider with correct data via XML
    Then I should receive OK message
    And the provider should be updated

  Scenario: Update a provider with bad request
    Given there is a provider
    When I update that provider with incorrect data via XML
    Then I should receive Bad Request error
    And the provider should not be updated

    #  Scenario: Attempt to update non existing provider
    #    Given the specified provider does not exist in the system
    #    When I attempt to update the provider
    #    Then I should receive a Provider Not Found error
    #    And the provider should not be updated

  Scenario: Delete Provider
    Given there is a provider
    When I delete that provider via XML
    Then I should receive an OK message
    And the provider should be deleted

  Scenario: Attempt to delete non-existant provider
    Given the specified provider does not exist in the system
    When I attempt to delete the provider
    Then I should receive Not Found error
    And no provider should be deleted
