Feature: Manage Images
  In order to manage my cloud infrastructure
  As a user
  I want to manage instances

  Background:
    Given I am an authorised user
    And I am logged in

  Scenario: Uploading a template without specifying the file
    Given there is a pool family named "testpoolfamily"
    And I am on the new image page for "testpoolfamily"
    When I fill in "base_image_name" with "my template"
    And I press "file_button"
    Then I should see an error message

  Scenario: Edit an invalid XML when creating an image
    Given there is a pool family named "testpoolfamily"
    And I am on the pool families page
    And I am on the new image page for "testpoolfamily"
    When I fill in "base_image_name" with "my template"
    And I attach the file "features/upload_files/template.xml" to "template_file"
    And I check "edit"
    And I press "file_button"
    Then I should be on the edit xml images page

# FIXME - This test is failing, but fixing it requires fixing a larger bug: we don't
